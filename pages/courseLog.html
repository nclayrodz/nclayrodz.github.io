    <h3>Lecture One: Web Dev 101</h3>
<p>This was are first lecture for this course, but I could not be in person this week at BMC. So I joined through Zoom!
    Sadly Zoom was not working well *insert sad emoji*... Alex tried his best to make sure it was working properly though, which we appreciated a lot! 
    I was able to learn about his career path and what his experience in the industry has been, which is always interesting to hear as a student! </p>
<h3>Lecture Two:</h3>
<p>For this lecture we learned a lot more about HTML and CSS! We mainly learned how to add linkable pages to our website. Additionally, 
    we learned how to add images to our website. I was able to add images to the clickable links of my Course Log, MRP page, my Project Development page. 
    I am excited to learn more about web development in the upcoming weeks! I feel linkethe course website changed so much and it makes me a lot more clear on how
    how to code for my MRP.</p>

<h3>Lecture Three:</h3>
</p>During class we learned valuable information on what the preproduction process looks like, the steps and the value that each stage has 
    for the production pipeline. We also looked at storybording and animatics.</p>

    <h3>Lecture Four:</h3>
</p>We talked about the pre-production when you are using media  that has a non linear flow to it, so we have a better idea of how 
we will navigate our projects as well as defining each of the steps. The most important part of the course for me was seeing what each phase entailed, 
because some phases are named in a way that I wouldn't have thought that was it was referring to. Example: Script. </p>

<h3>Lecture Five: Our Projects and Scrollytelling</h3>
</p>-OOP So I just found out these diaries should be 500 words long. Sorry Alex.  We defined what scrollytelling which is the natural way of scrolling through a story and its very intuitive because of this. Somethimg great about scrollytelling it immerses 
the user into the story. Something I didnt know is that althouth scrollytelly is better suited for linear stories,n you can have interactive variables (although thi shouldn't be the main focus).
Interesting quote that explains it perfectly, "Scrolling is a continuation. Clicking is a decision" (forgot who said that in Alex's presentationn). In scrollytelling, you control the narrative of the story and at what point what the user sees, in other words you
define and trigger specific "story beats". i thought this was so interesting, and although my groups proyect does not incoorporate storytelling, I am interested in the process. Another thing he mentioned in class that I think is very important is to have visual feedback, and akkow the user to adjust their 
throughout. Towards the end of the class we discussed last week's quiz and going over where students were confused the most. This was super helpful, because I found some questions 
in the quiz that I was not completely clear on, and was confused by.</p>
