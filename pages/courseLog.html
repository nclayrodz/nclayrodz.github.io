    <h3>Lecture One: Web Dev 101</h3>
<p>This was are first lecture for this course, but I could not be in person this week at BMC. So I joined through Zoom!
    Sadly Zoom was not working well *insert sad emoji*... Alex tried his best to make sure it was working properly though, which we appreciated a lot! 
    I was able to learn about his career path and what his experience in the industry has been, which is always interesting to hear as a student! </p>
<h3>Lecture Two: Coming soon...</h3>
