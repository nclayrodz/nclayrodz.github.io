    <h1>project updates!</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html"> I want to go back!</a></p>
   
   <h2>Week 01: Getting started</h2>

   <p> So far, I think we've been doing a really great job as a group! Over the past week, we did a ton of content research 
    and found so much useful information for our AR project. To keep things organized (and to avoid stepping on each other's toes), 
    we split up different topics among group members. Each person took on a specific area to research, and then we all came together 
    to share our findings and discuss how to incorporate them into the project. I think this method really helped us stay efficient 
    while making sure we covered all the important aspects. </p>
    <p>I was assigned to look into the positive impacts on marine life, and I found some super interesting things! After diving into the research (pun intended), 
    I discovered that coral nurseries, coral shading, and mangroves would be game-changing variables to include in our project.
    Coral shading is a method used to help protect corals from bleaching, which happens when ocean temperatures rise too much. 
    The idea is to provide shade—kind of like putting an umbrella over a coral reef—so the water around it stays cooler. It's a relatively new method, but it's showing
    promise in preventing coral damage.Then there are coral nurseries, which are basically underwater coral farms designed to help restore damaged reefs. In these nurseries, 
    small coral fragments are grown and nurtured under controlled conditions before being transplanted back into the ocean. This method 
    speeds up coral recovery and helps bring life back to areas that have been affected by bleaching, storms, or human activity.
    Then there are mangroves, which I honestly didnit realize were so important until now. We even considered not incoorporating them but my research
    convinced them (woohooo). They don't just provide shelter for marine animals; they also protect coastlines from erosion, filter water, and store carbon,
    making them a huge asset for both marine and land ecosystems. I read on a website They're basically nature's overachievers (thought that was funny lol), doing everything 
    at once while looking cool at the same time. Everyone brought amazing ideas to our discussion, and I think we've built a really strong foundation for this project. Seeing 
    how all of our research is coming together has been really exciting, and I can't wait to see how everything takes shape over the next few weeks!<p/>
     
     
    Right now, we're deep into pre-production mode, and everyone is working on different aspects of the project. I'm mostly focused on writing the script, but I'm also 
    collaborating closely with the wireframe and UI team to make sure everything fits together smoothly. It's really interesting to see how all the different parts—design, 
    research, and storytelling, come together to create something interactive and engaging. One of the things I've enjoyed most about this project so far is the game-based approach we're taking. 
    Instead of just creating a static AR experience, we've decided to add mini-games, which will make everything way more engaging. And the best part? I got to suggest one of them! The mini-game 
    for coral nurseries and coral shading was my idea, and I'm really excited to see it come to life. The idea is that players will get to help restore coral reefs by shading corals and growing baby 
    corals in a nursery, watching the reef come back to life as they play. Working on this project has been so much fun, and I'm really looking forward to seeing how everything is going to turn out!

     <h2>Week 02: Building the Script!</h2>
     <p>So my pre production role is writing the script for the project :)I'm going to write the script for the project, making sure it's clear, engaging, and informative. To refine it, I'll be working closely with
        Max and Yu-Wen, collaborating to ensure that the content matches the wireframes etc. . Our goal is to create an experience that draws players in, keeps them engaged, and helps them learn.
        This week after class, Jeah, Max, and I met with Alex to get a better understanding of how animations would be imported into Unity. Alex had a lot of useful info—animations can be ported from Maya to Unity using OBJs and FBXs, or for simpler ones, they can just be made directly in Unity. We also went over how idle states with looping animations can be swapped out when variable pieces are added or removed. Alex also brought up an important point—should the animation only play after the mini-game, or should there be an immediate reaction when the piece is placed? He suggested that having an instant response would better match user expectations and make the interaction feel more natural. We also talked about the mini-game interface, which is looking way too small right now. Definitely something that’ll need adjustments, especially with the previsualization draft deadline coming up. We also made some changes to the mini game for the mangrove. After that, I spent a few more hours talking through project details with Jeah and Max! Annnnnd after that I made necessary changes to the script.</p>

     <h2>Week 03: ~rest~</h2>
    
     <h2>Week 04: 3D Modelling</h2>
     <p>This week, I focused on 3D modeling for the project, which was both a challenge and a lot of fun. I worked in Maya, making sure to stick to our low-poly design style while modeling a bird, bat, fish, mangrove seedling, and two adult mangroves.
        I specifically chose this role because I wanted to get more practice with Maya—I've forgotten way too much, and it was about time I refreshed my skills. It was honestly hilarious realizing I had even forgotten how to apply a new material. That moment of staring at the screen like, wait… how do I do this again? really hit me. But once I got back into it, it was actually really fun getting into 3D modeling again.
        Yu-Wen and I set up a two-day window to get everything done, which made it feel like a fun challenge. We even came in on Friday to work together and power through the last bits. By the end of the day, though, I was completely exhausted.
        At one point, I took a nap on a yoga mat in the advanced lab, and some random people—well, people outside of BMC, I should say—walked through the department and saw me passed out. I can only imagine what they were thinking—probably something like Wow, she must be working so hard on some intense science or surgical project. Meanwhile, in reality, I was just taking a break from extruding a cylinder. Alas, extruding is hard and making a bad from a cylinder is somewhat a flex in my eyes, now that I think about it.</p>
        
    <h2>Week 05-06: 3D Printing and Component Design</h2>
     <p>Advancements in 3D Printing and Component Design
        A key challenge I tackled was finding an efficient and reliable way to connect 3D-printed pieces in a manner that allows them to be easily assembled and disassembled—similar to LEGO-style connections. Initially, I considered dovetail joints, but they didn’t provide the level of stability needed while maintaining ease of separation.
        Through research, I discovered a designer who had developed a specialized connector optimized for 3D printing. Though primarily designed for FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) printing, I wanted to explore its viability with resin-based printing as well. After testing, I found that the type of resin available at BMC is too rigid for the connector’s intended flexibility. While the connection does hold together, repeated use could eventually lead to breakage due to material brittleness. This insight has been valuable in determining material limitations and will inform future design iterations.
        
        Mangrove Mini-Game Redesign
        In addition to the 3D printing research, I collaborated with Max and Jeah to refine the mangrove mini-game. The game’s script needed updates to better align with the evolving mechanics and objectives of the overall project. This process involved revisiting the environmental impact messaging, ensuring that the cause-and-effect relationships were clear and engaging for players. By refining the script, we improved the game’s educational accuracy while enhancing its interactive elements.
        
        Wireframe Revisions and UI Improvements
        To enhance the user experience, I also revisited and reworked several wireframes for the game interface. The updated wireframes better reflect the current state of the project, incorporating feedback from recent testing and design discussions.
