   <h2>Project Development</h2>

   <p> So far, I think we've been doing a really great job as a group! Over the past week, we did a ton of content research 
    and found so much useful information for our AR project. To keep things organized (and to avoid stepping on each other's toes), 
    we split up different topics among group members. Each person took on a specific area to research, and then we all came together 
    to share our findings and discuss how to incorporate them into the project. I think this method really helped us stay efficient 
    while making sure we covered all the important aspects. </p>
    <p>I was assigned to look into the positive impacts on marine life, and I found some super interesting things! After diving into the research (pun intended), 
    I discovered that coral nurseries, coral shading, and mangroves would be game-changing variables to include in our project.
    Coral shading is a method used to help protect corals from bleaching, which happens when ocean temperatures rise too much. 
    The idea is to provide shade—kind of like putting an umbrella over a coral reef—so the water around it stays cooler. It's a relatively new method, but it's showing
     promise in preventing coral damage.
     Then there are coral nurseries, which are basically underwater coral farms designed to help restore damaged reefs. In these nurseries, 
     small coral fragments are grown and nurtured under controlled conditions before being transplanted back into the ocean. This method 
     speeds up coral recovery and helps bring life back to areas that have been affected by bleaching, storms, or human activity.
     Then there are mangroves, which I honestly didnit realize were so important until now. We even considered not incoorporating them but my research
     convinced them (woohooo). They don't just provide shelter for marine animals; they also protect coastlines from erosion, filter water, and store carbon,
     making them a huge asset for both marine and land ecosystems. I read on a website They're basically nature's overachievers (thought that was funny lol), doing everything 
     at once while looking cool at the same time. Everyone brought amazing ideas to our discussion, and I think we've built a really strong foundation for this project. Seeing 
     how all of our research is coming together has been really exciting, and I can't wait to see how everything takes shape over the next few weeks!
     
     
     Right now, we're deep into pre-production mode, and everyone is working on different aspects of the project. I'm mostly focused on writing the script, but I'm also 
     collaborating closely with the wireframe and UI team to make sure everything fits together smoothly. It's really interesting to see how all the different parts—design, 
     research, and storytelling, come together to create something interactive and engaging. One of the things I've enjoyed most about this project so far is the game-based approach we're taking. 
     Instead of just creating a static AR experience, we've decided to add mini-games, which will make everything way more engaging. And the best part? I got to suggest one of them! The mini-game 
     for coral nurseries and coral shading was my idea, and I'm really excited to see it come to life. The idea is that players will get to help restore coral reefs by shading corals and growing baby 
     corals in a nursery, watching the reef come back to life as they play. Working on this project has been so much fun, and I'm really looking forward to seeing how everything is going to turn out!
