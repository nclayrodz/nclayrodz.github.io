    <h2>Class Reflections</h2>
    <h3>Lecture One: Web Dev 101</h3>
    <p>This was are first lecture for this course, but I could not be in person this week at BMC. So I joined through Zoom!
        Sadly Zoom was not working well *insert sad emoji*... Alex tried his best to make sure it was working properly though, which we appreciated a lot! 
        I was able to learn about his career path and what his experience in the industry has been, which is always interesting to hear as a student! </p>
    <h3>Lecture Two: Coming soon...</h3>
    <h2>MRP Description</h2>
    <p> My MRP is in ethnodermatology. Ethnodermatology, can be defined as the study of skin conditions and treatments in different ethnic groups. For my MRP I am 
        creating a virtual resource for Primary Care Providers to be able to familiarize themselves with the appearance of eczema and its different types (total of 7).
        In order to help docotrs be able to recognize the apperance of eczema across diffrent skin tones, which usually they are only taught using examples of lighter complexions.
        I will be also adding features to adjust not only skin tone, but severity, body part and lighting conditions (this one might not be done, it all depends) </p>
